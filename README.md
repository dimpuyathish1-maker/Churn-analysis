I imported the data into Power BI and transformed it on Power Query
Renamed the data from customer_churn_data to Customer Data for clarity
Removed unwanted columns like customer id and predicted salary etc
Categorized data like Product which included 0,1,2 where converted to Product 1  2 3
Grouped age column like young middle and aged same goes to credit score as low and good and balance column as low balance, moderate balance and good balance
Formatting
For active_member column, 0 = dormant, 1 = active
For churn column, 0 = not churned, 1 = churned
For credit_card column, 0 = no, 1 = yes
Removed duplicates and transformed data type to suited form 
And visualized
